## Introduction ##
First of all, I welcome YOU, fellow ninja to this long forgotten repository. Actually, this is a challenge I found in HackerTrail for [CXA](https://www.hackertrail.com/cxa?sc=listatus).

In essence, this is a test to parse a JSON data received (received from where I am not too sure as they weren't clear - **A sample set of (random) client data is provided in JSON format**. This could mean that the data could be from a Web API or from a JSON file uploaded to the web page.

## Getting Started ##

**Prerequisite:**


1. [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) & [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) has to be installed
2. [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) has to be installed (this is due to this project is using SASS. Perhaps I should just use LESS so that this dependency is not required. Hmm)

### Step By Step ###
1. Once you have clone this repository, run **npm install** (This will install all dependencies including bower)
2. Once that is done WITHOUT errors, run **gulp dev** (This will set all the dependencies: .CSS, JS & HTML templates onto index.html)
3. Once that is done too without any errors, run **npm start**. This will start a simple HTTP NodeJS server (so, you can still run this app without having to spin up your own server (eg: Apacher server / OSX's inbuilt python server)

### Notes ###

1. If you would like to use the template used here, you can refer to [AngularJS Starting Template](https://github.com/tlkiong/angularjs_starting_template). This same template can be used in an Ionic framework project albeit some slight edits to fit Ionic's project structure. In case its not noticeable, that template is created by me.
